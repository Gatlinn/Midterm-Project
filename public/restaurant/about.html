<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>
  We are a small family owned italian restaurant started by Gertrude and Lorenzo Russo. We are an Italian restaurant
  based in the greater Seattle area. We opened in January 2017. The owner Lorenzo grew up in Seattle and has
  been a member of the community giving back in any way possible. Because of this Pizzeria Italiano is committed
  to donating our remaining food at the end of the day to Operation Sack Lunch. In their time off Gertrude and
  Lorenzo volunteer at Operation Sack Lunch using their culinary knowledge to cook flavorful and healthy meals
  for the homeless population of Seattle.
